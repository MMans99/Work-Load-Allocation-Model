# Information & Usage

The application is codded to have 5 different previlages:
 - Normal User 
 - Chairman
 - Vice Dean/Assistant Dean
 - Dean
 - Administrator 

Admin User gets to the dashboard which has the following data:
 - Users
 - Ranks 
 - Profiles 
 - Departments
 - Courses

Normal Users get to the dashboard which has their loaded information compared with their expected hours based on their profile selection, they can update their credits and work load efforts anytime, in addition of other account settings such as changing departments/courses/password.

Chairman Users acts as a normal user but could also see other users's information and data within his department only, and not other department users.

Vice Dean/Assistant Dean acts like a chairman user but could see every department user, however he can't see the dean's data.

Dean acts like Vice Dean/Assistant Dean, but could see everyone's information including other deans as well.
